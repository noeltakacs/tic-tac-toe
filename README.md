<h1 align="center">TicTacToe</h1>

## ü§î What is this?
<strong> TicTacToe is a classic game with a unique twist, designed specifically for Android. Unlike typical Tic Tac Toe apps, this version allows you to play on larger grids of 5x5 or 10x10, offering a more challenging and engaging experience. This app was one of my first ventures into mobile development, featuring several functionalities that enhance gameplay. </strong>

## ü´∂ How can you help?
This project is special to me as it represents the beginning of my journey into mobile development. That said, it's still far from perfect. There are a few areas where I could use some help:

<strong>Documentation:</strong> The code lacks proper documentation and comments, making it difficult for others to contribute. Any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>
<strong>Design Improvements:</strong> The current design is quite plain. If you have a knack for UI/UX, I'd love some assistance in making the app more visually appealing.<br><br>
<strong>Feature Enhancements:</strong> Have ideas for new features? Feel free to suggest or implement them!

## üì† License
